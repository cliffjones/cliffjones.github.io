> “*Dreck* takes the reader on a journey through layers of narrative, each chapter having its own exciting logic, but be prepared for slippage and landslides along the way. Cliff Jones Jr. revels in a fragile world, where ghosts haunt your smart lenses, virtual reality intersects with dreams, and even life and death are more states of mind than physical processes. A brilliant exploration of technology’s strange new borderlands.”<footer>—[+Jeff Noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Noon)</footer>
