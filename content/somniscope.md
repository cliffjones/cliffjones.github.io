# Somniscope: A Dreampunk Convergence

Another lonely night, another borrowed dream. You know you&rsquo;ll never get to sleep on your own, so why bother trying? It&rsquo;ll only waste time, and you&rsquo;ve got to be up in six hours. Five and a half now.

It&rsquo;s this momentary relief that keeps you coming back night after night.
