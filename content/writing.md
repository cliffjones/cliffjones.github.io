## Short Stories

### ![>cover of Mirror Mirror: A Compendium of Fractured Fairytales](covers/mirror-mirror) Eli and the Golden Caves

A somewhat modern retelling of the ancient Welsh folk tale of Elidyr. Elements of this story blur together with my own troubled childhood in rural Texas. I never stumbled upon any such subterranean kingdom though, to my great regret.

Look for “Eli and the Golden Caves” in *Mirror Mirror*, available through [+Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Compendium-Fractured-Fairytales-ebook/dp/B09NTZP38F), [+Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mirror-mirror-emily-barnett-kudeviz/1140801185), [+Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mirror-Mirror-Paperback-9781737920724/664166059), and others.

### Tending the Underworld

Told in the first person in a fictional dialect of English, this is the first of my stories in a collection I plan to call *Pixieland* (if I ever get around to finishing it). It combines nanotech and Egyptian mythology into a strange sort of folksy space opera.
