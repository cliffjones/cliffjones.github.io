I also make [art](https://cliffjonesjr.com/art) from time to time.

My big focus lately has been on the niche genre of [dreampunk](https://whatisdreampunk.com/). You’ve probably seen it, you may have read it, and you might actually be a fan—even if you’ve never heard the term before. I love this type of trippy, creepy, surreal fiction so much I’ve even put together a multi-author [anthology](https://whatisdreampunk.com/mirrormaze) of it (with [another](https://whatisdreampunk.com/somniscope) in the works).
