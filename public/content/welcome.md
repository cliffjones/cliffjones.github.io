[![}Cliff Jones Jr.](cliff-2021)](/social) I’m a [writer](/writing) and a [software developer](/coding) with a background in [linguistics](/language). I also make [art](/art) from time to time.

I create artisanal human-generated stories, most of which fit into the niche genre of [dreampunk](/dreampunk). You’ve probably seen it, you may have read it, and you might actually be a fan—even if you’ve never heard the term before. I love this type of trippy, creepy, surreal fiction so much that I put together a couple of multi-author collections: [*Mirrormaze*](/mirrormaze) and [*Somniscope*](/somniscope)!

If you want to learn more about me, read on or connect with me on [social media](/social).
