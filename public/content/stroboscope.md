# Stroboscope

A dark room is recommended, with your eyes closed and the screen fairly close to your forehead. It starts off flashing at a frequency of 10 Hz. Click or tap the screen to cycle between 8 and 16 Hz.

**Warning:** This kind of flashing is not safe for people with [+photosensitive epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitive_epilepsy). Use with caution. If you understand the risks, go ahead and ~stroboscope start it up~.
