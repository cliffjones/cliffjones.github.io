# Visual Artwork

## Colorful

^!![an ant with glowing eyes](electric-ant)
Inspired by the classic story [+“The Electric Ant”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Ant) and my own novella *Dreck* (due out in August), this is acrylic on cardboard with some digital manipulation.

^!![white rabbit holding a candle](tyrro-rabbit-painting)
I painted this for my still-in-progress novel [*The Lasting Lands*](/the-lasting-lands). This is a character named Tyrl, sort of like the White Rabbit of Wonderland… but not really.

^!![Adelaide with a dress made of sky](adelaide-sky)
And this is Adelaide, the main character of [the book](/the-lasting-lands). It could use some work, but you get the idea.

^!![a stylized haunted house](art/haunted-house)
I made this haunted house from old photographs using a technique I developed involving parallel lines of varying thickness.

^!![Philip K. Dick portrait: "The Empire Never Ended"](pkd-tene)
This portrait of [+Philip K. Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick) was based on my somewhat impromptu entry in El Paso’s 2014 [+Chalk the Block](http://www.chalktheblock.com/) festival. The line is from [+*VALIS*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valis_(novel)).

^!![Adelaide Batiste](art/rings-adelaide)
Adelaide Batiste of [*The Lasting Lands*](/the-lasting-lands).

^!![Thrako as a firecat](art/rings-thrako)
Thrako of [*The Lasting Lands*](/the-lasting-lands) as a firecat.

^!![a circular maze with a two-headed lamb](2hl-maze)
This is a maze I designed for the cover of my unfinished, currently-on-hold novel [*Two-Headed Lamb*](/writing).

## Ephemeral

^!![snow sculpture of a forest giant](bigfoot-snow)
Here’s a yeti I made out of snow! I grew up in a part of Texas where it rarely snows even an inch. This was basically my first real snowman.

^!![an ogre made from chili powder](ogre-chili-powder)
This is fun to do at restaurants while waiting for the food to come. Just shake some pepper on a plate, and get to work!

^!![Django Reinhardt made from salt](django-salt)
Here’s a salty portrait of the great [+Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt).

^!![-a jumping Mario portrait made out of bottlecaps](art/bottlecap-mario)
This bottlecap portrait of [+Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario) shouldn’t have been ephemeral, but I haven’t been able to find it anywhere for years, so I’ve pronounced it dead.

## Animation

^!![-Flower of Life with rotating colors](anim/flower-spin)
![-Flower of Life with fracturing segments](anim/flower-fracture)
Here are a couple of variations on the [+Flower of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid) pattern.

^!![animated Versailles labyrinth star](anim/versailles-star)
This is a weird little animation I put together for [the *Mirrormaze* anthology](/mirrormaze) based on [+the labyrinth of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_labyrinth_of_Versailles).

^!![Cliff Jones Jr. smoking a pipe](anim/cliff-pipe-colors)
And finally, here’s me smoking a pipe in the woods.
