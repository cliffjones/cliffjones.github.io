## ![}cover of Mirrormaze: A Dreampunk Anthology](covers/mirrormaze) Mirrormaze: A Dreampunk Anthology

“We find ourselves in a very strange place.” A 22-author collection spanning multiple traditional genres, [*Mirrormaze*](https://whatisdreampunk.com/mirrormaze) takes you on a mind-bending journey through the collective unconscious.

I have several stories in this one:

- [+“Pipe Dream”](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/pipe-dream)
- [+“Angel in the Cave”](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/angel-in-the-cave)
- [+“A Bottle of Jinn”](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/a-bottle-of-jinn)
- [+“Dorothy in the Land of Poppies”](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/dorothy-in-the-land-of-poppies)
- [+“So Long”](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/so-long)

Plus I did the lettering for the cover and designed the labyrinth inside. This book is my baby!
