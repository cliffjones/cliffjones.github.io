# The Lasting Lands

I’ve had this novel in progress since 2014, when I first got serious about writing fiction. It’s part portal fantasy like *Alice in Wonderland* or *The Wizard of Oz*, part Tolkienesque epic fantasy, and part trippy SF along the lines of Philip K. Dick or James Tiptree Jr.

Check back here later for a publishing announcement.
