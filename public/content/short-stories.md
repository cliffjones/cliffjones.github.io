## ![>cover of Mirror Mirror: A Compendium of Fractured Fairytales](covers/mirror-mirror) Eli and the Golden Caves

A somewhat modern retelling of the ancient Welsh folk tale of Elidyr. Elements of this story blur together with my own troubled childhood in rural Texas. I never stumbled upon any such subterranean kingdom though, to my great regret.

## Tending the Underworld

Told in the first person in a fictional dialect of English, this is the first of my stories in a collection I plan to call *Pixieland* (if I ever get around to finishing it). It combines nanotech and Egyptian mythology into a strange sort of folksy space opera.
