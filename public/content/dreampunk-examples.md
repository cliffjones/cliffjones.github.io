# How About Some Examples?

Theory is fine and all, but let’s get down to it: Here are some awesome [books](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/dreampunk-in-print), [movies](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/dreampunk-in-film), and [series](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/dreampunk-on-tv) that are great examples of the genre in my opinion. Feel free to add your own examples in the comments.

While you’re at it, check out my [Dreampunk Manifesto](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/dreampunk-manifesto), [profile interviews](https://cliffjones.substack.com/t/dreampunk-profiles) with authors, [“Dreampunk Around the Web”](https://cliffjones.substack.com/p/dreampunk-around-the-web), and [other dreampunk-related posts](https://cliffjones.substack.com/t/dreampunk) I’ve made.
