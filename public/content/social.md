## News and Networking

### [+~icon mastodon~ Mastodon](https://sfba.social/@cliffjones)

A decentralized, open-source microblogging system that many people flocked to after Twitter went downhill. Always free to use and free of ads.

### [+~icon bluesky~ Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cliffjones.bsky.social)

Another contender to fill the void left in this post-Twitter world.

### [+~icon threads~ Threads](https://www.threads.net/@cliffjonesjr)

Yet another Twitter replacement, this one backed by Meta (i.e. Facebook/Instagram).

### [+~icon facebook~ Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/mrcliffjonesjr)

For all its flaws, still a decent place to keep in touch with family and friends, particularly the older ones. I also have a [+dreampunk group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/dreampunk) here.

### [+~icon reddit~ Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/whatisdreampunk)

I want to like this one a lot more than I actually do. Pretty good content, but the flip side of that is that if you just want to post random crap, they make that kind of difficult.

### [+~icon linkedin~ LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cliff-jones-b2567227)

This can be handy when looking for a job, but that’s about it.

### [+~icon xtwitter~ Xitter](http://twitter.com/cliffjonesjr)

Twitter used to be a nice place to network with [+other writers](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1231856887311802368). Sadly, “X” has become a nest of bigots, trolls, and spammers. I’m only keeping my account in the hopes that Elon sells it off and the new owner cleans things up somehow.

## Multimedia

### [+~icon instagram~ Instagram](http://instagram.com/cliffjonesjr)

I use this to post photos of stuff I find interesting. No big whoop.

### [+~icon youtube~ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu3tev2uZ3Fh5ggVJq5IExA)

I don’t post videos often at all, but I’d like to change that.

### [+~icon tumblr~ Tumblr](http://whatisdreampunk.tumblr.com/)

In my experience, this is a mesmerizing time-waster. Good for exploring vibes and aesthetics.

## Reading and Writing

This is like an extension of my website that allows commenting. My posts here are mostly free, but I also include short stories and special goodies for paid subscribers.

## Shopping

### [+Threadless](https://dreampunk.threadless.com/)

Buy some merch, like T-shirts and stickers I designed.

### [+Redbubble](https://whatisdreampunk.redbubble.com/)

An alternative merch source that I hear works better outside the United States.
