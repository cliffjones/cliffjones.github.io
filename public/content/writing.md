# My Writing

I’m a [+Watty-Award](https://www.wattpad.com/wattys)-winning [dreampunk](/dreampunk)/[+irrealist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrealism_(the_arts)) author and editor with a background in [linguistics](/language) and [software development](/coding). My stories tend to tackle heavy philosophical and spiritual questions using pulp genre tropes and absurdist humor.
