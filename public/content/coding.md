### [Stroboscope](https://cliffjonesjr.com/stroboscope)

While doing some research on [+William S. Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs) for a [short story](/writing), I came across [+this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJFgNMVePaQ) on [+Brion Gysin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brion_Gysin)’s [+Dreamachine](https://importantrecords.com/products/brion-gysins-dreamachine), a sort of DIY flicker generator used for meditation with the potential to trigger hallucinations. So of course I decided to make my own.

### [![>a still of an animated eye](fv-eye-capture) Floravision](https://cliffjonesjr.com/floravision)

I found myself wondering, *What if instead of square pixels, we used the overlapping circles of the [+Flower of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid) pattern?* So I tried it. And it’s mesmerizing.

Making new animations is just a matter of dropping different images onto the page. It’ll work with any images of at least 78 by 75 pixels. Fine detail is lost, of course, but it’s a pretty cool effect, I’d say.

### [Hexagraph](https://cliffjonesjr.com/hexagraph)

This is a work in progress. I have ideas for more variations, but for now it's sort of like Zen water painting with overlapping hexagons.

### [+Neologizer](https://github.com/cliffjones/neologizer)

Neologizer analyzes the structure of words in a given text and uses what it learns to make up new words. You may find a practical use for such neologizing (filler text, brand naming, etc.), but mostly it’s just fun.

### [+Geometric Phoenician](https://codepen.io/cliffjones/pen/QWKGgQO)

This is a very simple, logical writing system I developed that corresponds to the original 22 sounds of the Phoenician (a.k.a. Old Hebrew, Proto-Sinaitic, etc.) alphabet. In my version, we have 20 consonants (with an implied neutral vowel) and two stand-alone vowels, so this is technically more of an abugida than a true alphabet. Anyhow, it looks cool as heck!

### [+Cipher Lesson](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/cipher-lesson/4614234511507456)

This is a simple introductory programming lesson I designed for use with my daughter, who was about eight at the time. Each line is commented with a number corresponding to the steps outlined in the opening comment.

### [+![>a screen shot of a key-painted character](key-painter-crazy-hair) Key Painter](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/key-painter/5578510789246976)

This is a fun little app I put together for Khan Academy that lets you paint with your mouse while selecting colors with your keyboard. Colors can be blended and adjusted in real time.

### [+![>a screen shot of the presentation](phonological-features) Phonological Features as Overlapping Elements](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/phonological-features-as-overlapping-elements/6163632156573696)

This is my contribution to Khan Academy’s linguistics section. Several methods of phonological analysis are illustrated in parallel, including my own system, which I developed while working on [+my master’s thesis](https://lscmontgomerycac.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/developmentalvariation_cliffjones.pdf "Developmental Variation in Children’s Acquisition of Metrical Structures").

### [+![>a screen shot of a swirly animation](dwitter-swirl) Dwitter](https://www.dwitter.net/u/CliffJonesJr)

My Dwitter feed hosts a variety of trippy canvas-based JavaScript animations, all 140 characters or less! (Don’t look here for good coding style though. It’s all about keeping under that character limit.)

### [+POLLI](https://github.com/cliffjones/polli)

This **P**ractically **O**rganic **L**anguage **L**earning **I**nstrument is a command-line language acquisition simulator. The more input it receives, the better conversation it makes.
